# Rust Short URL Service

Simple URL shortening service written in Rust. The service provides a basic API allowing clients to pass a long URL and receive a shortened version for easy access and sharing.

```
Usage: rust-short-url.exe [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -m, --mode <MODE>
          Mode this service will be running in [possible values: in-memory, persistent, coordinator]
  -a, --application-url <APPLICATION_URL>
          Address this service will be running on
      --hostnames <HOSTNAMES>
          List of host names separated by space to coordinate requests between
  -h, --help
          Print help
```

## Settings
Application settings can be configured in `development.toml` or `production.toml` files. Possible configurations include mode of the application, API server configuration, database connection, rate limiting and coordinator options.

## HashService
The `HashService` trait represents a service responsible for managing urls operations, such as initialization, retrieving links, inserting values, and finding information associated with a key.

## HTTP Server
HTTP server exposes several endpoints for the clients, such as:
* GET /urls - get all urls
* GET /shorten?long_url{url} - shorten given long url
* GET /{short_url} - redirect to url behind this shortened version
* GET /{short_url}/summary - get summary information about provided short url

## Data replication
The application can be launched in coordinator mode, coexisting with multiple regular instances within the same deployment. To enable coordination, a list of hostnames for these instances must be provided. In this mode, the application constructs a hash ring that encompasses all instances. Upon receiving a request, it forwards the request to all other machines, awaits acknowledgments from each, and then returns a response.

From the client's perspective, it appears as a single application. However, the underlying data is replicated across all instances. This replication enables fine-grained control over the consistency and availability of the data. When considering `N` as the number of replicas, `W` as the write quorum (considered successful if acknowledged by W replicas), and `R` as the read quorum (considered successful if acknowledged by R replicas), the following scenarios arise:

- If `R = 1` and `W = N`, the system is optimized for fast reads.
- If `W = 1` and `R = N`, the system is optimized for fast writes.
- If `W + R > N`, strong consistency is guaranteed (typically with `N = 3`, `W = R = 2`).
- If `W + R <= N`, strong consistency is not guaranteed.

# Run in Development

To run the service in development mode, use the following command:

```cmd
cargo run
```

By default, the `development.toml` configuration is used, and `RUN_MODE='development'` is set.

# Run in Production

Follow these steps to run the service in production:

* Configure MongoDB connection in `production.toml`.
* Set the environment variable `RUN_MODE` to 'production':
```
$env:RUN_MODE='production'
```
* Execute the following command:
```
cargo run
```

# Run in a Docker Container

To run the service using Docker Compose, use the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

This command launches the service along with its dependencies defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

# Run in coordinator mode

To run multiple instances, use the following command:
```
00_start.ps1
```
Example output:
```
Instance 1 started on port 63975
Instance 2 started on port 63976
Instance 3 started on port 63977
Coordinator started on port 80
```

# Usage

Execute a POST request to shorten a URL. Example:
```
curl -X GET "http://localhost/shorten?long_url=https://doc.rust-lang.org/"
```

The response will contain a short URL, e.g., `localhost/1C96D51A`.

You can now use `localhost/1C96D51A` as the shortened URL.
